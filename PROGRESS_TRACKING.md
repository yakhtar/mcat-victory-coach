Based on analysis of leading MCAT platforms, implementing:
- **Question Distribution**: Cell Biology (200), Molecular Biology (180), Biochem Integration (170), Organ Systems (250), Genetics (120), Evolution (80)
- **Type Ratio**: 60% passage-based, 40% discrete (different from biochem's 70/30)
- **Difficulty**: 20% Foundation, 45% Intermediate, 25% Advanced, 10% Elite
- **Quality Standards**: Match AAMC blueprint, focus on 515+ score differentiation

#### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Create Biology question generator class
2. Generate Cell Biology questions (200 target)
3. Generate Molecular Biology questions (180 target)
4. Continue through all 6 biology categories
5. Update API endpoints to serve Biology questions
6. Integrate Biology into UI filters
