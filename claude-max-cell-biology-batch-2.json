    "passage": "Researchers investigating membrane dynamics in polarized epithelial cells discovered that disruption of tight junctions leads to altered distribution of membrane proteins between apical and basolateral domains. When cells were treated with calcium chelators to disrupt adherens junctions, they observed that Na+/K+-ATPase, normally restricted to the basolateral membrane, began appearing in the apical membrane. Additionally, alkaline phosphatase, typically localized to the apical surface, was found distributed throughout the lateral membranes. Electron microscopy revealed that tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin were no longer concentrated at cell-cell contacts.",
    "question": "Based on the experimental observations, what is the primary function of tight junctions in maintaining epithelial cell polarity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They provide mechanical strength to prevent cell separation",
      "B": "They serve as a selective barrier preventing lateral diffusion of membrane proteins",
      "C": "They regulate transcytosis between apical and basolateral compartments", 
      "D": "They control the expression of polarity-specific membrane proteins"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The experimental evidence shows that when tight junctions are disrupted, membrane proteins lose their polarized distribution - Na+/K+-ATPase moves from basolateral to apical, and alkaline phosphatase spreads from apical to lateral domains. This demonstrates that tight junctions function as a selective barrier that prevents the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins between apical and basolateral domains, thus maintaining epithelial polarity. Option A is incorrect because adherens junctions, not tight junctions, primarily provide mechanical strength. Option C is wrong because the experiment doesn't address transcytosis. Option D is incorrect because the proteins are still expressed but mislocalized, indicating tight junctions don't control expression but rather distribution.",

      "A": "Ribosome assembly in the nucleolus",

      "D": "Chromatin condensation during mitosis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Ran is crucial for nuclear transport, existing as RanGTP in the nucleus and RanGDP in the cytoplasm. This gradient drives both nuclear import and export. If the GTPase activity of Ran is inhibited while GTP binding remains intact, Ran would remain in the GTP-bound state. This would disrupt the normal cycling between RanGTP and RanGDP that is essential for nuclear export. Export complexes depend on RanGTP hydrolysis to release cargo in the cytoplasm. Option A is incorrect because ribosome assembly doesn't directly depend on Ran GTPase cycling. Option C is wrong because DNA replication initiation involves other regulatory mechanisms. Option D is incorrect because chromatin condensation is primarily regulated by condensins and histone modifications, not directly by Ran.",

    "passage": "During muscle contraction, calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and bind to troponin C, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from myosin-binding sites on actin filaments. This allows myosin heads to bind to actin, forming cross-bridges. ATP hydrolysis provides the energy for the power stroke, during which myosin heads pivot and pull actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. A new ATP molecule then binds to myosin, causing cross-bridge dissociation and resetting the myosin head for another cycle.",
    "question": "What would be the immediate consequence if ATP became unavailable during the cross-bridge cycle?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Calcium would not be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum",
      "B": "Tropomyosin would remain bound to myosin-binding sites",

      "D": "Myosin heads would lose their ability to bind to actin"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C", 
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. ATP is required for cross-bridge dissociation - when a new ATP molecule binds to myosin, it causes the myosin head to detach from actin. Without ATP, the cross-bridges would remain formed in a permanent contractile state, similar to rigor mortis. This prevents muscle relaxation because the myosin heads cannot detach from actin filaments. Option A is incorrect because calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum doesn't directly require ATP (though calcium reuptake does). Option B is wrong because tropomyosin movement is calcium-dependent, not ATP-dependent. Option D is incorrect because myosin can bind to actin without ATP; ATP is needed for detachment, not binding.",

PEX19 is known to bind to peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) in the cytoplasm. Based on this information, what is the most likely function of PEX19?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The evidence shows that without functional PEX19, peroxisomal structures cannot form normally, even though matrix proteins are present. Since PEX19 binds to peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) in the cytoplasm, its most likely function is to facilitate the insertion of these PMPs into peroxisomal membranes, which is essential for peroxisome biogenesis. Without proper membrane formation, peroxisomes cannot assemble correctly. Option A is incorrect because matrix proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm, suggesting that membrane formation (not matrix protein import) is the primary defect. Option C is wrong because PEX19 is involved in biogenesis, not metabolic function. Option D is incorrect because the proteins are made but cannot assemble properly, indicating a post-translational rather than transcriptional defect.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The primary structural difference between rough and smooth ER is the presence of ribosomes. Rough ER has ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface, giving it a 'rough' appearance, while smooth ER lacks attached ribosomes. This structural difference determines their functional specializations: rough ER is involved in protein synthesis and processing, while smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and detoxification. Option A is incorrect because it reverses the functions. Option C is wrong because both types of ER are found in both plant and animal cells. Option D incorrectly assigns the detoxification function to rough ER when it's actually a function of smooth ER.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in mammalian cells found that accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates three distinct signaling pathways mediated by IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6. When cells were treated with tunicamycin to induce ER stress, IRE1α undergoes autophosphorylation and its endoribonuclease domain becomes active, leading to unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA. The spliced XBP1 then translocates to the nucleus and upregulates genes involved in ER protein folding capacity. Simultaneously, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to general translational attenuation but paradoxically increased translation of ATF4.",
    "question": "Why does PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α lead to increased translation of ATF4 despite general translational attenuation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "ATF4 mRNA is transcriptionally upregulated during ER stress",

      "D": "ATF4 mRNA is spliced by IRE1α to increase its translation efficiency"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. ATF4 mRNA contains upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' untranslated region. Under normal conditions, ribosomes translate these uORFs and then dissociate, preventing translation of the main ATF4 coding sequence. However, when eIF2α is phosphorylated during ER stress, translation initiation is generally inhibited, but this paradoxically allows ribosomes to bypass the inhibitory uORFs and instead initiate translation at the main ATF4 start codon. This mechanism allows selective translation of specific stress response genes like ATF4 even when general protein synthesis is reduced. Option A is incorrect because the question specifically asks about translational, not transcriptional, regulation. Option C is wrong because it doesn't explain the translational mechanism. Option D is incorrect because IRE1α splices XBP1, not ATF4 mRNA.",

The myosin II motor proteins generate contractile force by sliding along actin filaments, similar to muscle contraction but in a ring-like structure at the cell equator. This contractile ring gradually constricts, eventually pinching the cytoplasm in two to complete cell division. Option B is incorrect because microtubules and dynein are involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis but not in the actual cytokinesis process. Option C is wrong because intermediate filaments provide structural support but don't generate contractile force. Option D is incorrect because myosin I is involved in various cellular processes but myosin II is the specific motor protein required for cytokinesis.",

They are highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells, their levels decrease during differentiation, and forced overexpression can reprogram differentiated cells back to pluripotency. The ChIP-seq data showing they bind to stemness genes while repressing differentiation genes further confirms their role as master regulators that maintain the pluripotent state and prevent inappropriate differentiation.
