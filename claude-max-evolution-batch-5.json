    "passage": "Researchers studying punctuated equilibrium examined fossil records to understand patterns of evolutionary change over time. They found that many species show long periods of morphological stasis interrupted by brief periods of rapid evolutionary change, often coinciding with speciation events. This contrasts with the gradualism model that predicts steady, continuous evolutionary change. The scientists discovered that rapid evolutionary change often occurs in small, isolated populations under strong selective pressure, while large, stable populations tend to show stasis due to stabilizing selection and gene flow that homogenizes variation.",
    "question": "Based on punctuated equilibrium theory, when is rapid evolutionary change most likely to occur?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Continuously at a steady rate in all populations",
      "B": "During speciation events in small, isolated populations under strong selective pressure",
      "C": "Only in large, stable populations with high gene flow",
      "D": "Never, because evolution is always gradual"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'rapid evolutionary change often occurs in small, isolated populations under strong selective pressure' and is associated with 'speciation events.' Small populations allow genetic drift and selection to act more effectively, while isolation prevents gene flow from counteracting change. Option A describes gradualism. Option C describes conditions favoring stasis. Option D contradicts the observed rapid change periods.",

Sharks (cartilaginous fish), dolphins (mammals), and ichthyosaurs (extinct reptiles) are distantly related but evolved similar streamlined body shapes for efficient swimming. This is classic convergent evolution where similar environmental pressures (aquatic locomotion) lead to analogous adaptations in unrelated lineages. Option A is incorrect - they're distantly related.

    "passage": "Scientists investigating the evolution of eusociality (highly organized social systems with reproductive division of labor) discovered that this complex behavior evolved independently multiple times, particularly in Hymenoptera (ants, bees, wasps). They found that haplodiploidy (males develop from unfertilized eggs, females from fertilized eggs) creates unusual genetic relationships that may favor the evolution of worker sterility. In haplodiploid species, sisters share 75% of their genes on average, making them more related to each other than they would be to their own offspring (50% relatedness). This supports Hamilton's rule for the evolution of altruistic behavior.",
    "question": "Based on this eusociality research, how does haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera potentially favor the evolution of worker sterility?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Workers are more closely related to their sisters (75%) than to potential offspring (50%), favoring helping sisters reproduce",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The passage explains that in haplodiploid species, 'sisters share 75% of their genes on average, making them more related to each other than they would be to their own offspring (50% relatedness).' According to Hamilton's rule (rB > C), helping sisters reproduce can be more beneficial genetically than reproducing yourself when relatedness is higher. Option B is mechanistically incorrect.

    "passage": "A research team studying industrial melanism examined how pollution affected moth populations in industrial areas of England. Before industrialization, light-colored peppered moths were common and well-camouflaged against lichen-covered tree bark, while dark (melanic) moths were rare and easily spotted by predators. During the Industrial Revolution, soot pollution darkened tree trunks, making light moths conspicuous and dark moths well-camouflaged. The frequency of melanic moths increased dramatically in polluted areas. After pollution controls were implemented, tree trunks became lighter again, and light moth frequencies increased while dark moth frequencies decreased.",
    "question": "Based on this industrial melanism study, what does this example demonstrate about natural selection?",

      "A": "Natural selection only works in polluted environments",

      "D": "Industrial pollution creates new mutations in moth populations"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. This classic example shows that natural selection can respond rapidly to environmental changes - first favoring dark moths during industrial pollution, then favoring light moths again after pollution controls. The selective advantage of each color morph depended on the environment, demonstrating that fitness is context-dependent. Option A limits selection to one environment. Option C ignores environmental context. Option D confuses selection acting on existing variation with mutation creation.",

They discovered that each transition involved changes in how information is stored, transmitted, and expressed, often requiring new mechanisms to prevent conflicts between different levels of organization (genes vs. cells, cells vs. organisms, individuals vs. groups). The scientists concluded that these transitions share common themes of cooperation, division of labor, and the suppression of lower-level selection.",
    "question": "Based on this major transitions research, what common challenge must be overcome in evolutionary transitions like the evolution of multicellularity?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage emphasizes that major evolutionary transitions 'often require new mechanisms to prevent conflicts between different levels of organization' and involve 'the suppression of lower-level selection.'

Point mutations can alter target proteins to reduce drug binding, while gene duplications can increase target protein levels to overwhelm drug effects. Horizontal gene transfer can spread resistance genes rapidly between bacterial species through plasmids, transformation, and transduction. The researchers found that sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations create selective pressure favoring resistant variants, and that combination therapies using multiple drugs can slow resistance evolution by requiring multiple simultaneous mutations.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that combination therapies 'can slow resistance evolution by requiring multiple simultaneous mutations.'
