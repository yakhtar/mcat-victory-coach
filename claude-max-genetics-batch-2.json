    "passage": "Researchers studying pedigree analysis examined inheritance patterns in human families to identify disease susceptibility genes. They found that autosomal dominant disorders appear in every generation, affect both sexes equally, and show vertical transmission from parent to child. In contrast, autosomal recessive disorders often skip generations, may affect siblings but not parents, and require both parents to be carriers. X-linked recessive disorders predominantly affect males, show oblique transmission (from affected grandfather through carrier daughter to affected grandson), and are never passed from father to son.",
    "question": "Based on these inheritance patterns, which mode of inheritance would most likely show affected males in multiple generations but never father-to-son transmission?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Autosomal dominant",
      "B": "Autosomal recessive",
      "C": "X-linked recessive",
      "D": "Mitochondrial inheritance"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. X-linked recessive inheritance shows affected males in multiple generations through oblique transmission (grandfather to grandson via carrier daughters) but never shows father-to-son transmission because fathers pass their Y chromosome, not X chromosome, to sons. Option A would show father-to-son transmission. Option B typically skips generations. Option D shows maternal inheritance.",

They discovered that DNA methylation and histone modifications can be maintained through cell divisions and sometimes through meiosis, creating heritable changes in gene expression without altering DNA sequence. The researchers found that environmental stresses like famine or toxin exposure can alter methylation patterns in germ cells, affecting not only the directly exposed individual but also their offspring and even grandchildren. This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance challenges the traditional view that inheritance is solely determined by DNA sequence changes.",

    "passage": "A research team studying gene expression regulation discovered that enhancers and silencers can control transcription from great distances. They found that enhancer sequences can be located thousands of base pairs away from gene promoters but still regulate transcription through DNA looping that brings distant regulatory elements into contact with promoter regions. The scientists observed that tissue-specific transcription factors bind to these enhancers, creating unique gene expression patterns in different cell types. They concluded that this complex regulatory network allows the same genome to produce vastly different cell types during development.",
    "question": "Based on this gene regulation system, how can enhancers regulate distant genes?",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",

Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, if p and q are the frequencies of two alleles, then genotype frequencies are p² (AA), 2pq (Aa), and q² (aa), which sum to 1.

    "passage": "Researchers investigating CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing discovered how this system can precisely modify specific DNA sequences. The Cas9 nuclease is guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) that contains a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA and a scaffold region that binds Cas9. When the sgRNA-Cas9 complex encounters target DNA with a matching sequence adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), Cas9 creates a double-strand break. The researchers found that cells repair these breaks through either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which often introduces small insertions or deletions, or homology-directed repair (HDR) when a donor template is provided.",

      "D": "Random binding occurs throughout the genome"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that specificity requires both 'a 20-nucleotide sequence complementary to the target DNA' in the sgRNA and the presence of 'a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)' next to the target site. Both elements are necessary for Cas9 to cut at the correct location. Option A is incorrect - Cas9 needs the guide RNA. Option C ignores the guide sequence requirement.

For example, variations in CYP2D6 affect metabolism of many psychiatric medications, while CYP2C19 polymorphisms influence proton pump inhibitor effectiveness. The researchers found that these genetic differences can dramatically alter drug efficacy and toxicity, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches.",
