    "passage": "Researchers investigating DNA repair mechanisms discovered that cells have multiple systems to detect and correct DNA damage. Base excision repair (BER) handles small base modifications like deamination or oxidation through glycosylases that remove damaged bases, followed by AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase to fill the gap. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) addresses bulky DNA lesions like thymine dimers by recognizing helical distortions and removing 12-30 nucleotide patches. The scientists found that defects in these repair systems lead to increased mutation rates and cancer susceptibility, demonstrating the critical importance of genome maintenance.",
    "question": "Based on this DNA repair system, which type of repair mechanism would primarily handle UV-induced thymine dimers?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Base excision repair (BER)",
      "B": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER)",
      "C": "Mismatch repair (MMR)",
      "D": "Homologous recombination"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that nucleotide excision repair (NER) 'addresses bulky DNA lesions like thymine dimers by recognizing helical distortions.' UV-induced thymine dimers create bulky lesions that distort the DNA helix, making NER the appropriate repair mechanism. Option A (BER) handles small base modifications. Options C and D address different types of DNA problems.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The 5' cap is added by guanylyltransferase (capping enzyme), which adds GMP to the 5' triphosphate of nascent mRNA and then methylates the cap structure. This occurs co-transcriptionally when the nascent mRNA is only 20-30 nucleotides long. Option A synthesizes RNA but doesn't add the cap. Option C adds the poly(A) tail. Option D is involved in splicing.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying post-transcriptional gene regulation discovered that microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in controlling gene expression. MiRNAs are initially transcribed as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) that are processed in the nucleus by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex to produce precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA). These pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and further processed by Dicer to generate mature miRNAs. The mature miRNA is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where it guides the complex to complementary sequences in target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation.",
    "question": "Based on this miRNA biogenesis pathway, what would be the consequence of Dicer deficiency in cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Accumulation of pri-miRNA in the nucleus",

      "D": "Increased mRNA stability for all genes"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Dicer processes pre-miRNA in the cytoplasm to generate mature miRNAs. Without Dicer, pre-miRNAs would accumulate in the cytoplasm but couldn't be processed to functional mature miRNAs, effectively blocking miRNA function. Option A describes Drosha deficiency. Option C is incorrect as RISC needs mature miRNAs. Option D is too broad - only miRNA targets would be affected.",

    "passage": "A research team studying protein targeting discovered that newly synthesized proteins contain signal sequences that determine their cellular destination. Proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have N-terminal signal sequences that are recognized by signal recognition particles (SRP) during translation. This leads to ribosome docking at the ER membrane and co-translational translocation into the ER lumen. Proteins without signal sequences remain in the cytoplasm, while those with specific targeting sequences can be directed to mitochondria, peroxisomes, or the nucleus through post-translational import mechanisms.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that ER signal sequences 'lead to ribosome docking at the ER membrane and co-translational translocation into the ER lumen.'

    "passage": "Researchers studying the molecular basis of cancer investigated how oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes contribute to malignant transformation. They found that oncogenes like MYC and RAS promote cell proliferation and survival when activated, while tumor suppressor genes like TP53 and RB normally prevent uncontrolled growth by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress. The scientists discovered that cancer typically requires multiple hits - both oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation - following Knudson's two-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressors and the multi-step model of carcinogenesis.",
    "question": "Based on this cancer genetics model, why do most cancers require both oncogene activation and tumor suppressor loss?",

      "D": "Cancer cells need to maintain some growth control"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Normal cells have robust tumor suppressor mechanisms (like p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis) that can counteract oncogene activation. Only when these protective mechanisms are also lost can cells achieve the full malignant phenotype. This explains why cancer is typically a multi-step process requiring multiple genetic hits. Option B is incorrect. Option C is irrelevant. Option D contradicts cancer biology.",

When two replication forks meet, they form converged replication intermediates that require specific machinery for proper completion.

Additionally, they discovered that topoisomerases are essential for relieving the tension created when replication forks converge, preventing the formation of problematic DNA structures.",
