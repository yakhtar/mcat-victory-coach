    "passage": "Researchers studying DNA repair mechanisms discovered that cells have evolved multiple pathways to correct different types of DNA damage. Base excision repair (BER) corrects small base modifications like oxidation or alkylation by removing the damaged base and replacing it. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes bulky DNA lesions that distort the double helix, such as pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation. Mismatch repair (MMR) corrects replication errors by recognizing and removing mismatched bases. The researchers found that defects in these repair systems are associated with increased cancer risk and genetic disorders.",
    "question": "Based on these repair mechanisms, which type of DNA damage would most likely be repaired by nucleotide excision repair?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A single oxidized guanine base",
      "B": "A thymine dimer caused by UV radiation",
      "C": "An A-C mismatch from replication error",
      "D": "A missing phosphate group in the DNA backbone"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that NER 'removes bulky DNA lesions that distort the double helix, such as pyrimidine dimers caused by UV radiation.' Thymine dimers are bulky lesions that distort DNA structure. Option A would be repaired by BER (small base modification). Option C would be repaired by MMR (mismatch). Option D describes a backbone break requiring different repair mechanisms.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating chromatin structure discovered that nucleosomes, composed of histone octamers wrapped by DNA, are the basic repeating units of chromatin. The researchers found that histone modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, can alter chromatin structure and gene accessibility. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) add acetyl groups that generally promote transcription by loosening chromatin structure, while histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups and typically repress transcription. These modifications create an 'epigenetic code' that can be inherited through cell divisions without changing the underlying DNA sequence.",
    "question": "Based on this chromatin regulation, how do histone acetyl modifications affect gene transcription?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Acetylation always permanently silences genes",
      "B": "Acetylation neutralizes positive histone charges, loosening DNA binding and promoting transcription",

      "D": "Acetylation causes immediate DNA degradation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Histone acetylation neutralizes the positive charges on lysine residues, weakening the electrostatic attraction between histones and negatively charged DNA. This loosening allows transcription factors and RNA polymerase better access to DNA, promoting transcription. The passage confirms that HATs 'generally promote transcription by loosening chromatin structure.' Options A, C, and D misrepresent the effects of acetylation.",

    "passage": "A research team studying enzyme regulation found that allosteric enzymes can exist in two conformational states: a tense (T) state with low substrate affinity and a relaxed (R) state with high substrate affinity. According to the concerted model, all subunits of the enzyme switch between states simultaneously. Positive allosteric effectors (activators) bind preferentially to the R state and shift the equilibrium toward the active form, while negative allosteric effectors (inhibitors) bind preferentially to the T state and shift the equilibrium toward the inactive form. This regulation allows sensitive control of enzyme activity.",

      "D": "They increase the total number of enzyme molecules in the cell"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that positive allosteric effectors 'bind preferentially to the R state and shift the equilibrium toward the active form.'

    "passage": "Researchers studying protein quality control discovered that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR involves three main pathways: IRE1α splices XBP1 mRNA to produce an active transcription factor; PERK phosphorylates eIF2α to reduce protein synthesis; and ATF6 is cleaved to release an active transcription factor. These pathways coordinately reduce ER protein load, increase folding capacity, and activate ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to remove terminally misfolded proteins. If the stress cannot be resolved, the UPR can trigger apoptosis.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The passage describes how the UPR 'coordinately reduce[s] ER protein load, increase[s] folding capacity, and activate[s] ER-associated degradation (ERAD)' - a three-pronged approach that reduces incoming proteins (PERK pathway), enhances folding ability (IRE1α/XBP1 and ATF6 pathways), and removes unfoldable proteins (ERAD).

These RNA elements undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding that can affect transcription termination, mRNA stability, or translation efficiency. The researchers found that riboswitches are particularly common in bacteria and plants, and they typically regulate genes involved in the metabolism of their cognate ligands. This represents an ancient form of gene regulation that predates protein-based regulatory systems.",
