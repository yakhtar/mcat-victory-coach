    "passage": "Researchers studying transcription termination in prokaryotes discovered two main mechanisms: intrinsic (Rho-independent) and extrinsic (Rho-dependent) termination. Intrinsic termination relies on the formation of hairpin structures in the mRNA that destabilize the RNA polymerase-DNA complex, followed by a series of U-A base pairs that further weaken the interaction. Rho-dependent termination requires the Rho protein, which is an ATP-dependent helicase that chases RNA polymerase along the nascent mRNA transcript. When Rho catches up to a paused polymerase, it disrupts the transcription complex and causes termination.",
    "question": "Based on these termination mechanisms, what is the key difference between intrinsic and Rho-dependent termination?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Intrinsic termination requires ATP while Rho-dependent does not",
      "B": "Intrinsic termination relies on RNA secondary structure while Rho-dependent requires a protein factor",
      "C": "Only Rho-dependent termination occurs in eukaryotes",
      "D": "Intrinsic termination only works on the lagging strand during replication"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Intrinsic termination depends on RNA hairpin structures and weak U-A base pairs that naturally destabilize the polymerase complex, while Rho-dependent termination requires the Rho protein (an ATP-dependent helicase) to actively disrupt transcription. Option A is backwards - Rho-dependent termination requires ATP. Option C is incorrect as these are prokaryotic termination mechanisms. Option D confuses transcription with replication.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. DNA topoisomerases (particularly topoisomerase II in eukaryotes) relieve the supercoiling tension that builds up ahead of the replication fork as DNA helicase unwinds the double helix. Option A (helicase) unwinds DNA but doesn't relieve supercoiling. Option B (primase) synthesizes RNA primers. Option D (ligase) joins DNA fragments but doesn't affect supercoiling.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying ribosome structure and function discovered that the peptidyl transferase center, responsible for peptide bond formation, is composed entirely of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) rather than ribosomal proteins. This finding established that ribosomes are ribozymes - RNA molecules with catalytic activity. The researchers found that the rRNA provides both the structural framework and the catalytic activity for protein synthesis, while ribosomal proteins primarily serve structural and regulatory roles. The discovery that RNA can have catalytic function revolutionized understanding of early evolution and the 'RNA World' hypothesis.",

      "D": "Ribosomes were the first organelles to evolve in cells"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The fact that rRNA catalyzes protein synthesis supports the 'RNA World' hypothesis, which proposes that RNA preceded proteins as catalytic molecules since RNA can both store genetic information (like DNA) and catalyze reactions (like proteins). This suggests RNA came first and later evolved the ability to make proteins. Option A is backwards. Option C is incorrect as DNA lacks catalytic activity.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that attach specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, creating aminoacyl-tRNAs that can be used in protein synthesis.

These domains can be evolutionarily mobile, appearing in different combinations across various proteins. The researchers found that domain shuffling through recombination events has been a major mechanism for protein evolution, allowing organisms to create new proteins with novel functions by combining existing functional domains. This modular organization explains why many proteins share similar structural motifs despite having different overall functions.",

The 5' cap (7-methylguanosine) serves multiple functions: it protects mRNA from 5' exonuclease degradation, facilitates nuclear export, and is essential for translation initiation by helping ribosomes recognize and bind to mRNA.

    "passage": "Researchers investigating the molecular basis of aging discovered that telomeres, the protective DNA-protein structures at chromosome ends, shorten with each cell division in most somatic cells. This occurs because conventional DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 5' ends of linear chromosomes, creating the 'end-replication problem.' Telomerase, containing both protein (TERT) and RNA (TERC) components, can extend telomeres by adding TTAGGG repeats using its internal RNA template. The researchers found that telomerase activity is high in stem cells and germ cells but low in most somatic cells, contributing to cellular aging and senescence.",
    "question": "Based on this telomere biology, why does the end-replication problem specifically affect the 5' ends of chromosomes?",

      "D": "DNA helicase cannot unwind DNA at 5' chromosome ends"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. DNA polymerases synthesize DNA only in the 5' to 3' direction and require a 3'-OH group to add new nucleotides. At chromosome ends, when the RNA primer of the lagging strand is removed, there's no way to fill in the gap at the 5' end because there's no upstream 3'-OH group available.
