    "passage": "Researchers studying alternative splicing discovered that a single gene can produce multiple protein isoforms through differential intron removal and exon inclusion. They found that tissue-specific splicing factors and regulatory sequences called exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) control which exons are included in the mature mRNA. The scientists observed that approximately 95% of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, greatly expanding the diversity of the proteome beyond what would be predicted from genome size alone.",
    "question": "Based on this alternative splicing mechanism, how does the number of possible proteins compare to the number of genes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The number of proteins equals the number of genes",
      "B": "The number of possible proteins can exceed the number of genes due to alternative splicing creating multiple isoforms",
      "C": "Alternative splicing reduces the number of proteins below the gene count",
      "D": "Only genes with introns can produce proteins"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that alternative splicing allows 'a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms' and that this 'greatly expanding the diversity of the proteome beyond what would be predicted from genome size alone.' Since 95% of multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing, the protein diversity far exceeds gene number. Option A ignores alternative splicing. Option C is backwards. Option D is incorrect about protein production.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating chromatin remodeling discovered that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes can alter nucleosome positioning to regulate gene access. These complexes, including SWI/SNF, ISWI, and CHD families, use ATP hydrolysis to slide, eject, or restructure nucleosomes. The researchers found that different remodeling complexes have distinct functions: SWI/SNF complexes promote transcriptional activation by ejecting or sliding nucleosomes away from promoters, while ISWI complexes often space nucleosomes regularly for chromatin organization. They concluded that chromatin remodeling is essential for all DNA-templated processes including transcription, replication, and repair.",
    "question": "Based on this chromatin remodeling research, how do ATP-dependent remodeling complexes regulate gene expression?",

      "A": "They directly bind to DNA and prevent transcription factor access",

    "passage": "A research team studying telomeres discovered that these DNA-protein structures protect chromosome ends from degradation and fusion. Telomeres consist of repetitive DNA sequences (TTAGGG in humans) bound by shelterin proteins that form protective caps. The scientists found that during DNA replication, telomeres shorten due to the end-replication problem - DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3' ends of linear chromosomes. Telomerase, an enzyme containing both protein and RNA components, can extend telomeres by adding telomeric repeats, but it's only active in stem cells, germ cells, and unfortunately, many cancer cells.",
    "question": "Based on this telomere biology, why do telomeres shorten during normal DNA replication?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Telomeres are actively degraded by nucleases",
      "B": "DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3' ends of linear chromosomes (end-replication problem)",
      "C": "Shelterin proteins prevent telomere replication",
      "D": "Telomerase is overactive in normal cells"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explicitly states that 'telomeres shorten due to the end-replication problem - DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate the 3' ends of linear chromosomes.' This is because DNA polymerase requires a 3'-OH primer and synthesizes 5' to 3', making complete replication of chromosome ends impossible without telomerase. Option A describes degradation, not replication issues. Option C contradicts shelterin's protective role. Option D contradicts the limited telomerase activity described.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying p53 tumor suppressor function discovered that this protein acts as the 'guardian of the genome' by responding to various cellular stresses. When DNA damage is detected, kinases like ATM and ATR phosphorylate p53, stabilizing it and preventing MDM2-mediated degradation. Activated p53 functions as a transcription factor, upregulating genes involved in cell cycle arrest (p21), apoptosis (PUMA, BAX), and DNA repair. The scientists found that p53 mutations occur in over 50% of human cancers, highlighting its critical role in preventing malignant transformation.",
    "question": "Based on this p53 function, why is p53 phosphorylation important for its tumor suppressor activity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Phosphorylation directly repairs DNA damage",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that phosphorylation 'stabilizes p53 and prevents MDM2-mediated degradation' and that 'activated p53 functions as a transcription factor.' This stabilization is crucial because it allows p53 to accumulate and transcriptionally activate genes that promote cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
