    "passage": "Researchers studying cellular differentiation discovered that lineage commitment involves progressive restriction of cellular potency through epigenetic mechanisms. As cells differentiate from pluripotent to multipotent to fully committed states, they undergo chromatin remodeling that makes certain gene programs increasingly inaccessible. The scientists found that this process involves the establishment of repressive histone marks like H3K27me3 and DNA methylation at key regulatory regions. However, they also discovered that differentiation is not always irreversible, as demonstrated by cellular reprogramming and transdifferentiation experiments.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage describes how differentiation involves 'chromatin remodeling' and 'the establishment of repressive histone marks like H3K27me3 and DNA methylation' that make gene programs 'increasingly inaccessible.' These epigenetic modifications progressively restrict potency without permanently altering the DNA sequence itself. Option A is incorrect because genes are silenced, not degraded. Option C is wrong because chromosome segments aren't lost. Option D contradicts the reversibility mentioned in the passage.",

Critically short telomeres are recognized as DNA double-strand breaks, activating ATM and ATR kinases and downstream checkpoint pathways. The researchers found that this telomere-induced senescence differs from replicative senescence in that it can occur independently of cell division and involves more severe DNA damage signaling. Additionally, they observed that telomerase reactivation in aged cells can sometimes reverse senescence, but may also increase genomic instability if extensive damage has already occurred.",

The researchers found that calcium serves as a critical second messenger, and even small increases in cytosolic calcium can trigger significant cellular responses including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and changes in gene expression.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating cellular memory mechanisms discovered that transcriptional memory involves the formation of gene bookmarking - a process where certain transcription factors remain bound to mitotic chromatin even when most other factors are displaced. This bookmarking allows rapid reactivation of gene expression after cell division. The researchers found that bookmarking factors often have unique properties, such as the ability to bind condensed chromatin or association with specific histone modifications that persist through mitosis. Additionally, they discovered that some genes maintain transcriptional memory through the inheritance of permissive chromatin states marked by specific histone modifications.",

The passage describes how 'certain transcription factors remain bound to mitotic chromatin' and that these 'bookmarking factors often have unique properties' that allow them to maintain gene accessibility through mitosis for 'rapid reactivation' afterward.

During collective migration, cells maintain cell-cell junctions while the entire sheet moves as a unit. The researchers found that leader cells at the migration front extend protrusions and guide the direction, while follower cells are pulled along by mechanical coupling through adherens junctions. This coordinated movement allows for efficient wound closure while maintaining tissue integrity and barrier function.",

For example, the p53-Mdm2 circuit can exist in low-p53 (normal) or high-p53 (stress response) states.
