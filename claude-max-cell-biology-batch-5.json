    "passage": "Researchers studying membrane transport observed that certain cells can rapidly uptake glucose even when extracellular glucose concentrations are very low. These cells express high levels of GLUT1 transporters in their plasma membrane. When cells were treated with cytochalasin B, glucose uptake was dramatically reduced. Further experiments showed that GLUT1-mediated transport does not require ATP hydrolysis and can transport glucose bidirectionally across the membrane depending on the concentration gradient.",
    "question": "Based on the experimental observations, GLUT1-mediated glucose transport can best be classified as:",

      "A": "Active transport requiring ATP hydrolysis",

      "C": "Simple diffusion through membrane pores",
      "D": "Endocytosis followed by intracellular processing"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. GLUT1 mediates facilitated diffusion, which uses carrier proteins to transport substances down their concentration gradient without requiring energy. The key evidence includes: (1) transport occurs without ATP hydrolysis, ruling out active transport (option A), (2) cytochalasin B inhibition indicates protein-mediated transport, ruling out simple diffusion (option C), and (3) bidirectional transport based on concentration gradients is characteristic of facilitated diffusion, not endocytosis (option D). GLUT1 is a well-characterized glucose transporter that facilitates glucose movement across membranes.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The SRP receptor is located on the ER membrane and is essential for co-translational targeting of ribosomes to the ER. When SRP binds to signal sequences on nascent proteins, it guides the ribosome to the SRP receptor on the ER, allowing co-translational insertion of proteins into the ER membrane or lumen. Option A is incorrect because mitochondrial targeting uses different signal sequences and receptors (TOM/TIM complexes). Option C is wrong because SRP functions during translation, not post-translationally. Option D is incorrect because SRP receptor is not involved in ribosome assembly, which occurs in the nucleolus.",

    "passage": "In a study of cell cycle regulation, researchers observed that cells lacking functional p53 protein continue to progress through the cell cycle despite DNA damage. Normal cells with intact p53 arrest at the G1/S checkpoint when DNA damage is detected. The researchers found that p53 acts as a transcription factor that upregulates p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p21 specifically binds to and inhibits CDK2-cyclin E complexes, preventing phosphorylation of Rb protein. When Rb remains hypophosphorylated, it continues to bind E2F transcription factors, blocking S-phase gene expression.",
    "question": "Based on this regulatory pathway, which of the following would be the most direct molecular consequence of p53 loss in damaged cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Increased CDK2-cyclin E kinase activity leading to Rb hyperphosphorylation",
      "B": "Direct activation of E2F-dependent S-phase genes",
      "C": "Constitutive binding of Rb to chromatin throughout the cell cycle",
      "D": "Immediate progression to M-phase without DNA replication"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. The passage describes a regulatory cascade: p53 → p21 → CDK2-cyclin E inhibition → Rb hypophosphorylation → E2F sequestration. Loss of p53 would eliminate p21 upregulation, removing the brake on CDK2-cyclin E activity. This would lead to increased kinase activity and Rb hyperphosphorylation, which is the most direct consequence in the pathway. Option B is incorrect because E2F activation is downstream of Rb phosphorylation. Option C is wrong because Rb binding to E2F (not chromatin) is the mechanism, and this would actually decrease without p53. Option D is incorrect because the pathway specifically controls G1/S transition, not progression to M-phase.",

Anaphase is characterized by the separation of sister chromatids, which occurs when the cohesin proteins holding them together are cleaved by separase enzyme. The chromatids then move toward opposite poles of the cell along the spindle microtubules. Option A (prophase) is when chromosomes condense and the nuclear envelope breaks down. Option B (metaphase) is when chromosomes align at the cell's equator. Option D (telophase) is when nuclear envelopes reform around the separated chromosomes and the cell prepares for cytokinesis.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying peroxisome biogenesis discovered that these organelles can form through two distinct pathways: de novo formation from the ER and growth and division of existing peroxisomes. Peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported post-translationally via peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS1 and PTS2). PTS1 proteins contain a C-terminal tripeptide sequence (typically SKL) and are imported by the PEX5 receptor. When cells were treated with a compound that disrupts PEX5 function, catalase and other PTS1-containing enzymes accumulated in the cytosol instead of localizing to peroxisomes.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The experimental evidence clearly shows that when PEX5 function is disrupted, PTS1-containing proteins (including catalase) accumulate in the cytosol instead of localizing to peroxisomes. This demonstrates that PEX5 receptor is required for the post-translational import of PTS1 proteins. Option A is incorrect because the passage states proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, not within peroxisomes. Option C is wrong because the import is described as post-translational, not co-translational. Option D cannot be concluded from the given data, as the experiment specifically tested PTS1 proteins and PEX5; PTS2 proteins use different import machinery.",

Surprisingly, these cells could still complete mitosis, although the process took longer and showed increased rates of chromosome missegregation. The researchers observed that in the absence of centrosomes, spindle microtubules could still form through a pathway involving the Ran-GTP gradient around chromosomes and various microtubule-associated proteins. However, the resulting spindle was less focused and bipolar organization was compromised.",

Option A is incorrect because spindle formation still occurred without centrosomes. Option C is wrong because the data shows centrosome-mediated spindle formation is more efficient (faster, more accurate).

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. When activated by certain receptors, PLC cleaves PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate two second messengers: IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP3 then binds to IP3 receptors on the ER membrane, causing calcium release from intracellular stores. Inhibiting PLC would prevent IP3 formation and subsequent calcium release. Option A is incorrect because PLC doesn't directly transport calcium. Option C is wrong because PLC doesn't activate calcium pumps.

When Par3 was experimentally depleted, cells lost their polarized organization and tight junction integrity was compromised. Further analysis revealed that Par3 interacts with Crumbs protein at the apical surface and with Scribble protein at the basolateral surface. The researchers found that aPKC phosphorylates Lgl (Lethal giant larvae) protein, preventing its interaction with Scribble and maintaining the boundary between apical and basolateral domains.",

Constitutively active aPKC would continuously phosphorylate Lgl, permanently preventing Lgl-Scribble interactions that are important for basolateral identity. This would lead to expansion of apical characteristics at the expense of basolateral polarity. Option A is incorrect because tight junctions are specifically apical structures, not distributed throughout the surface. Option C is wrong because constitutively active aPKC would likely enhance, not eliminate, Par complex function.
