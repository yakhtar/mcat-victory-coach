    "passage": "Researchers studying cellular motility discovered that actin filament treadmilling is essential for cell migration. In treadmilling, actin monomers are continuously added to the barbed end (plus end) of filaments while being removed from the pointed end (minus end), creating a net forward movement of the filament without changing its overall length. This process is driven by ATP hydrolysis and is regulated by proteins such as profilin, which promotes monomer addition, and ADF/cofilin, which accelerates depolymerization at the pointed end. The researchers observed that disrupting treadmilling severely impairs the formation of lamellipodia and cell motility.",
    "question": "Based on this mechanism, what is the primary driving force for actin treadmilling?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mechanical tension applied by myosin motors",
      "B": "ATP hydrolysis coupled with asymmetric assembly and disassembly",
      "C": "Direct interaction with microtubules",
      "D": "Passive diffusion of actin monomers"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that treadmilling 'is driven by ATP hydrolysis' and involves asymmetric dynamics where monomers are 'continuously added to the barbed end...while being removed from the pointed end.' This ATP-driven asymmetric assembly/disassembly creates the net forward movement characteristic of treadmilling. Option A describes myosin function but not the driving force of treadmilling itself. Option C is not mentioned in the passage. Option D is incorrect because treadmilling is an active, energy-requiring process, not passive diffusion.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Caspase-3 is an executioner caspase that cleaves numerous cellular substrates during the execution phase of apoptosis, including structural proteins, DNA repair enzymes, and other targets that lead to the characteristic features of apoptotic cell death. Option B (Bcl-2) is an anti-apoptotic protein that prevents apoptosis. Option C (p53) can trigger apoptosis but doesn't execute it. Option D (cytochrome c) is released from mitochondria and helps activate caspases but doesn't directly cleave cellular proteins.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating the DNA damage checkpoint discovered that the ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase is specifically activated by single-stranded DNA coated with RPA protein. This occurs commonly at stalled replication forks where DNA polymerase encounters obstacles like DNA lesions or difficult-to-replicate sequences. Upon activation, ATR phosphorylates numerous downstream targets including Chk1 kinase, which then inhibits CDC25 phosphatases, preventing activation of S-phase and G2/M CDKs. This checkpoint mechanism allows time for fork restart mechanisms to resolve the problem and complete DNA replication accurately.",
    "question": "Based on this checkpoint pathway, what would be the most likely consequence of ATR kinase deficiency during DNA replication stress?",

      "A": "Enhanced DNA repair and increased replication accuracy",

      "C": "Complete blockade of DNA replication initiation",
      "D": "Immediate apoptosis upon encountering any replication obstacle"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. ATR deficiency would eliminate the checkpoint that normally detects replication problems and arrests cell cycle progression. Without ATR-Chk1 signaling to inhibit CDKs, cells would inappropriately progress through S-phase and into mitosis with incompletely replicated or damaged DNA, leading to genomic instability. Option A is incorrect because ATR deficiency would reduce, not enhance, the cellular response to replication stress. Option C is wrong because ATR responds to problems during replication, not initiation. Option D is incorrect because while ATR deficiency can eventually lead to cell death, the immediate consequence is checkpoint failure, not apoptosis.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying bacterial conjugation observed that F+ bacteria can transfer genetic material to F- bacteria through direct cell-cell contact. The F+ cells possess an F plasmid that encodes the machinery for pilus formation and DNA transfer. During conjugation, the F+ cell extends a pilus that contacts the F- cell and retracts, bringing the cells together. The F plasmid then undergoes rolling circle replication, and the newly synthesized single strand is transferred through the conjugation bridge to the recipient cell. After transfer, both cells synthesize complementary strands, resulting in two F+ cells.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Bacterial conjugation represents horizontal gene transfer where genetic material (the F plasmid) is transferred from one bacterium to another, increasing genetic diversity in the bacterial population. The F- recipient gains new genetic material and becomes F+. Option A describes binary fission, not conjugation. Option C describes sporulation, which is unrelated to conjugation.

These regulatory elements are bound by sequence-specific transcription factors and can be located thousands of base pairs away from the genes they regulate. The researchers found that enhancers work through DNA looping, where the enhancer region physically contacts the promoter region through the formation of chromatin loops stabilized by architectural proteins like CTCF and cohesin. This three-dimensional chromatin organization allows enhancers to deliver activating signals directly to promoters despite linear genomic distance.",
