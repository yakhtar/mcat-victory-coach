    "passage": "Researchers studying phylogenetic reconstruction discovered that molecular data provides powerful tools for understanding evolutionary relationships. They compared DNA sequences across multiple species to construct phylogenetic trees showing evolutionary branching patterns. The scientists found that molecular clocks - the observation that neutral mutations accumulate at roughly constant rates - allow estimation of divergence times between species. However, they also discovered that different genes evolve at different rates, with ribosomal RNA genes evolving slowly due to functional constraints, while pseudogenes evolve rapidly due to lack of selective pressure.",
    "question": "Based on this molecular phylogenetics research, why do ribosomal RNA genes evolve more slowly than pseudogenes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ribosomal RNA genes have higher mutation rates",
      "B": "Functional constraints on ribosomal RNA genes subject them to stronger purifying selection",
      "C": "Pseudogenes are under stronger positive selection",
      "D": "Ribosomal RNA genes are located in heterochromatin"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'ribosomal RNA genes evolving slowly due to functional constraints, while pseudogenes evolve rapidly due to lack of selective pressure.' Functional constraints mean that most mutations in ribosomal RNA would be harmful and removed by purifying selection, while pseudogenes have no function and can accumulate neutral mutations freely. Option A is backwards. Option C is incorrect - pseudogenes lack function. Option D relates to location, not selection.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Genetic drift has an effect inversely proportional to population size, becoming the dominant evolutionary force in very small populations where random sampling effects can overpower weak selection. In small populations, chance events can cause large changes in allele frequencies regardless of fitness effects. Option A becomes less effective in small populations. Option B is reduced in small, isolated populations. Option D introduces variation but doesn't change frequencies dramatically.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating the evolution of multicellularity discovered that this major transition occurred independently multiple times across different lineages. They found that multicellularity requires solving several evolutionary challenges: cell-cell cooperation, specialization of cell types, and prevention of cheating (cells that gain benefits without contributing to group function). The researchers discovered that mechanisms like kin selection (cells are genetically related), group selection (groups with better cooperation outcompete less cooperative groups), and developmental constraints (single-cell bottlenecks prevent cheating) all contribute to maintaining multicellular cooperation.",
    "question": "Based on this multicellularity evolution research, what prevents individual cells from 'cheating' in multicellular organisms?",

They found that mutations in regulatory regions of developmental genes can have large phenotypic effects by altering when, where, or how much of a gene product is made. The scientists discovered that changes in Hox gene expression patterns explain major body plan differences between arthropod groups, while modifications of BMP signaling pathways account for beak shape variation in Darwin's finches. They concluded that regulatory evolution is often more important than protein-coding evolution for morphological change.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying the evolution of altruism discovered that seemingly selfless behaviors can evolve through several mechanisms that resolve the apparent paradox of individuals helping others at their own expense. Hamilton's rule (rB > C) explains kin selection, where helping relatives can be favored when the benefit to kin, weighted by relatedness, exceeds the cost to the helper. Reciprocal altruism explains cooperation between unrelated individuals when there's potential for future reciprocation. The scientists also found evidence for group selection, where groups with more altruists outcompete groups with fewer altruists, even if altruists have lower fitness within groups.",
    "question": "Based on Hamilton's rule (rB > C), under what conditions would an altruistic act toward a sibling be evolutionarily favored?",
    "options": {
      "A": "When the cost to the altruist is always greater than the benefit to the sibling",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Hamilton's rule states that altruistic behavior is favored when rB > C, where r is relatedness, B is benefit, and C is cost. For full siblings, r = 0.5, so the altruistic act is favored when (0.5 × B) > C. This explains why individuals are more likely to help close relatives. Option A violates the rule.

They found that hybrid offspring often show reduced fitness due to genetic incompatibilities, but the extent of this reduction varies. In some cases, hybrids are completely sterile or inviable, creating strong barriers to gene flow. In other cases, hybrids have intermediate fitness and can backcross with parental species, creating clines of genetic variation across the hybrid zone. The researchers discovered that the width and stability of hybrid zones depend on the balance between selection against hybrids and dispersal of individuals into the zone.",
