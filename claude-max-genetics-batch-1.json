    "passage": "Researchers studying Mendelian inheritance patterns examined a cross between two heterozygous individuals (Aa × Aa) for a single gene. They observed that in the F2 generation, approximately 25% of offspring showed the recessive phenotype, while 75% displayed the dominant phenotype. When they examined the molecular basis of this trait, they found that the dominant allele (A) codes for a functional enzyme, while the recessive allele (a) produces a non-functional enzyme due to a nonsense mutation. Individuals with the AA or Aa genotype produce sufficient enzyme for normal phenotype, while aa individuals lack functional enzyme and display the recessive phenotype.",
    "question": "Based on this inheritance pattern, what can be concluded about the relationship between gene dosage and phenotype?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Two functional alleles are always required for normal phenotype",
      "B": "One functional allele is sufficient to produce the dominant phenotype (haploinsufficiency does not occur)",
      "C": "Recessive alleles always produce toxic proteins that interfere with normal function",
      "D": "Heterozygotes always show an intermediate phenotype between the two homozygotes"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage shows that both AA and Aa genotypes produce the dominant phenotype, indicating that one functional allele provides sufficient enzyme activity for normal function. This demonstrates that haploinsufficiency (where one functional copy is insufficient) does not occur for this gene. Option A contradicts the observation that Aa individuals are normal. Option C is incorrect - the recessive allele produces non-functional, not toxic, protein. Option D contradicts the observation that Aa shows the dominant phenotype.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying X-linked inheritance discovered that X-inactivation (lyonization) leads to mosaicism in heterozygous females. During early female development, one X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell, creating patches of cells expressing either the maternal or paternal X-linked allele. The researchers found that this process involves the long non-coding RNA Xist, which coats the inactivated X chromosome and recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes to establish heterochromatin. In some X-linked disorders, the severity of symptoms in heterozygous females depends on the pattern of X-inactivation - if most cells inactivate the normal X, symptoms may be severe.",
    "question": "Based on this X-inactivation mechanism, why might two heterozygous females with the same X-linked mutation show different symptom severity?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They have different mutations in the same gene",
      "B": "Random X-inactivation creates different ratios of cells expressing normal vs. mutant alleles",
      "C": "X-inactivation only occurs in males, not females",
      "D": "The Xist RNA functions differently in different individuals"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that X-inactivation is random in each cell during development, creating different patterns of which X chromosome is inactivated. If one female has mostly cells with the normal X active while another has mostly cells with the mutant X active, they will show different symptom severities despite having identical genotypes. Option A changes the premise. Option C contradicts the passage. Option D is not supported as the primary cause of variation.",

They performed a testcross between a heterozygous fly (normal wings, red eyes) and a homozygous recessive fly (vestigial wings, white eyes). In the offspring, they observed 42% parental combinations and 8% recombinant combinations. The researchers concluded that these genes are linked on the same chromosome, with a recombination frequency indicating their physical distance.",

    "correct_answer": "B",

    "passage": "Researchers investigating genomic imprinting discovered that certain genes are expressed differently depending on their parent of origin. For example, the IGF2 gene is only expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome, while the H19 gene is only expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome. This parent-specific expression is controlled by DNA methylation patterns established during gametogenesis. The scientists found that imprinting disorders can result from mutations in imprinting control regions, uniparental disomy (inheritance of both chromosomes from one parent), or assisted reproductive technologies that disrupt methylation patterns.",

      "D": "Random expression patterns unrelated to parental origin"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Uniparental disomy means both chromosomes come from the same parent. For imprinted genes that are only expressed from one parent (like IGF2 from father or H19 from mother), inheriting both chromosomes from the wrong parent would result in no expression of genes requiring the missing parent's chromosome. Option A ignores the imprinting effects. Option C assumes both copies would be expressed. Option D contradicts the established imprinting patterns.",

When the initial frequency of allele A was 0.6 and allele a was 0.4, the genotype frequencies in the population were AA = 0.36, Aa = 0.48, and aa = 0.16.
