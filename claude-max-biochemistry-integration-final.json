    "passage": "Researchers studying vitamin deficiencies examined how specific vitamin shortages disrupt metabolic pathways. They found that thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency impairs pyruvate dehydrogenase function, blocking efficient glucose oxidation and forcing cells to rely more on anaerobic glycolysis. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency affects flavin-dependent enzymes in fatty acid oxidation and the electron transport chain. Niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency reduces NAD+ availability, compromising both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. The scientists discovered that these vitamin deficiencies create overlapping metabolic disruptions that can manifest as fatigue, neurological symptoms, and impaired energy production across multiple tissues.",
    "question": "Based on this vitamin deficiency research, why does niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency severely impact energy metabolism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Niacin directly produces ATP in cells",
      "B": "NAD+ derived from niacin is essential for key oxidation reactions in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle",
      "C": "Niacin deficiency prevents all protein synthesis",
      "D": "Niacin is only needed for fatty acid synthesis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that 'niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency reduces NAD+ availability, compromising both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.' NAD+ is a crucial electron acceptor in multiple dehydrogenase reactions including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in glycolysis and several enzymes in the citric acid cycle. Option A incorrectly suggests direct ATP production. Option C overstates the protein synthesis effects. Option D incorrectly limits niacin's metabolic scope.",

      "A": "Fructose directly inhibits glucose transporters",

      "D": "Fructose is converted to lactate, causing acidosis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Hereditary fructose intolerance results from aldolase B deficiency, which cleaves fructose-1-phosphate. Without this enzyme, fructose-1-phosphate accumulates, trapping phosphate and depleting the phosphate pool needed for gluconeogenesis and glucose production. This leads to hypoglycemia despite normal glucose metabolism machinery. Option A describes a direct inhibition not seen in this condition. Option C relates to normal fructose metabolism. Option D misrepresents the metabolic block.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating metabolic plasticity in cancer examined how tumor cells reprogram metabolism to support rapid growth and survival in hostile environments. They discovered that many cancers upregulate glutamine metabolism, using glutaminolysis to fuel anabolic processes. Glutamine provides nitrogen for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis while its carbon skeleton (via α-ketoglutarate) supports the citric acid cycle and lipid synthesis. The researchers found that hypoxic conditions activate hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which promotes glycolysis while suppressing mitochondrial respiration. This metabolic reprogramming allows cancer cells to maintain energy production and biosynthesis even under oxygen-limited conditions that would severely impair normal cells.",
    "question": "Based on this cancer metabolism research, why is glutamine particularly important for cancer cell anabolism?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Glutamine produces more ATP than glucose",

      "D": "Glutamine prevents all DNA damage in cancer cells"
    },

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that 'glutamine provides nitrogen for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis while its carbon skeleton (via α-ketoglutarate) supports the citric acid cycle and lipid synthesis.' This dual role makes glutamine particularly valuable for rapidly dividing cells that need both building blocks (nitrogen) and metabolic intermediates (carbon skeletons).

    "passage": "A research team studying exercise metabolism examined the metabolic changes during different phases of physical activity. They found that during the first few minutes of intense exercise, muscles rely on stored ATP and creatine phosphate for immediate energy. As exercise continues, glycolysis becomes the dominant pathway, producing ATP rapidly but generating lactate. With prolonged moderate exercise, oxidative metabolism increases, utilizing both glucose and fatty acids. The scientists discovered that training status significantly affects this metabolic progression, with trained individuals showing enhanced fatty acid oxidation capacity and improved lactate clearance, allowing them to maintain higher intensities for longer periods.",
    "question": "Based on this exercise metabolism research, why do trained individuals show improved endurance performance?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Training eliminates lactate production entirely",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'trained individuals showing enhanced fatty acid oxidation capacity and improved lactate clearance, allowing them to maintain higher intensities for longer periods.'

Malonyl-CoA also inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), preventing fatty acid oxidation. This dual effect - promoting fat synthesis while blocking fat oxidation - exemplifies metabolic coordination during the fed state. Option A contradicts the malonyl-CoA effect on CPT-1.

They found that senescent cells undergo a metabolic shift toward glycolysis even in oxygen-rich conditions, similar to cancer cells but with different underlying mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction in aging cells leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and increased reactive oxygen species production. The scientists discovered that this metabolic dysfunction contributes to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), where senescent cells secrete inflammatory factors that affect neighboring cells. Additionally, they found that interventions targeting metabolic pathways, such as improving mitochondrial function or reducing oxidative stress, can delay cellular senescence and extend healthspan.",

Conversely, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the corresponding gluconeogenic enzyme, is inhibited by AMP and activated by ATP.

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that PFK-1 is 'inhibited by ATP and citrate (indicating high energy and abundant acetyl-CoA).' High citrate levels signal that the citric acid cycle is well-supplied with acetyl-CoA and energy production is adequate, so further glucose breakdown through glycolysis is unnecessary. This prevents wasteful glucose consumption when energy is abundant. Option A overgeneralizes citrate's effects. Option C misrepresents citrate's regulatory scope.
