    "passage": "Researchers investigating lysosomal function observed that cells treated with chloroquine accumulated undigested material in their lysosomes. Chloroquine is a weak base that becomes protonated and trapped in acidic compartments, raising their internal pH. The researchers noted that lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins have optimal activity at pH 5.0 and lose activity as pH increases toward neutral. Additionally, they found that the vacuolar H+-ATPase is responsible for maintaining the acidic pH gradient across lysosomal membranes.",
    "question": "Based on the experimental observations, why does chloroquine treatment lead to accumulation of undigested material in lysosomes?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Chloroquine directly inhibits cathepsin enzyme synthesis",
      "B": "Chloroquine disrupts lysosomal membrane integrity",
      "C": "Chloroquine raises lysosomal pH, reducing enzyme activity",
      "D": "Chloroquine prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Chloroquine is a weak base that becomes protonated and trapped in acidic lysosomes, effectively acting as a buffer that raises the internal pH. Since lysosomal enzymes like cathepsins have optimal activity at pH 5.0 and lose activity as pH rises, the chloroquine-induced pH increase reduces their digestive capacity, leading to accumulation of undigested material. Option A is incorrect because chloroquine doesn't affect enzyme synthesis. Option B is wrong because the passage doesn't indicate membrane disruption. Option D is incorrect because the issue is with digestion within lysosomes, not fusion with autophagosomes.",

The synaptonemal complex is a specialized protein structure that forms between homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis, facilitating their pairing (synapsis) and providing the structural framework for crossing over. Option A (cohesin) holds sister chromatids together, not homologous chromosomes. Option B (condensin) is involved in chromosome condensation. Option D (kinetochore proteins) are involved in chromosome attachment to spindle fibers during chromosome segregation, not in homolog pairing.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying telomerase regulation discovered that the enzyme consists of a catalytic protein subunit (TERT) and an RNA component (TERC) that provides the template for telomere synthesis. In most somatic cells, telomerase activity is very low, leading to progressive telomere shortening with each cell division. However, in stem cells and cancer cells, telomerase is highly active. The researchers found that TERT expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by factors such as c-Myc and p53. Additionally, they observed that telomerase assembly and activity are regulated post-translationally through TERT phosphorylation and subcellular localization.",
    "question": "Based on this regulatory mechanism, which of the following would most likely result in increased cellular senescence?",

      "A": "Overexpression of c-Myc transcription factor",

      "D": "Enhanced TERC RNA stability and expression"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. p53 is a tumor suppressor that generally represses TERT transcription as part of its growth-inhibitory functions. A constitutively active p53 mutation would lead to persistent repression of TERT expression, resulting in low telomerase activity, accelerated telomere shortening, and increased cellular senescence. Option A is incorrect because c-Myc typically activates TERT transcription, which would promote telomerase activity and delay senescence. Options C and D would both enhance telomerase function through post-transcriptional mechanisms, reducing rather than increasing senescence.",

    "passage": "A research team studying G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling observed that when cells are stimulated with a hormone, there is a rapid increase in cAMP levels within seconds. This response requires the activation of adenylyl cyclase by the Gs alpha subunit. However, when the same cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Gi/o proteins, the magnitude of the cAMP response was significantly enhanced. The researchers concluded that both stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins can be activated simultaneously by different GPCRs in the same cell.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The enhanced cAMP response following pertussis toxin treatment indicates that Gi/o proteins were normally providing inhibitory input to limit cAMP production. By inactivating Gi/o proteins, pertussis toxin removes this inhibitory brake, allowing the stimulatory Gs pathway to produce higher cAMP levels. Option A is incorrect because pertussis toxin doesn't directly affect adenylyl cyclase. Option C is wrong because the enhanced response suggests Gi/o proteins were also being activated. Option D is incorrect because pertussis toxin specifically targets Gi/o proteins, not all G proteins.",

Clathrin heavy chains, along with light chains, assemble into triskelions that polymerize to form the clathrin coat.

    "passage": "Researchers studying ribosome biogenesis found that the process involves the coordinated assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus. The 45S pre-rRNA precursor undergoes extensive processing, including pseudouridylation and methylation guided by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). These modifications are crucial for proper rRNA folding and ribosome function. When cells were treated with a drug that specifically inhibits RNA polymerase I, which transcribes the 45S pre-rRNA, ribosome production ceased and cells eventually underwent apoptosis due to the inability to maintain protein synthesis.",
    "question": "Based on the experimental results, which statement best explains why RNA polymerase I inhibition leads to cell death?",
    "options": {
      "A": "RNA polymerase I inhibition directly damages existing ribosomes",
      "B": "Loss of rRNA transcription prevents new ribosome assembly, eventually depleting the ribosome pool",

      "D": "SnoRNA-guided modifications cannot occur without ongoing RNA polymerase I activity"

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. RNA polymerase I specifically transcribes the 45S pre-rRNA, which is processed to generate the major rRNA species (18S, 5.8S, 28S) needed for ribosome assembly. Inhibiting RNA pol I stops new rRNA production, preventing new ribosome assembly. Since existing ribosomes are gradually degraded during normal cellular turnover, the ribosome pool becomes depleted, leading to insufficient protein synthesis capacity and eventual cell death. Option A is incorrect because the drug doesn't damage existing ribosomes. Option C is wrong because mRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Option D is incorrect because snoRNA modifications occur on existing pre-rRNA, not during transcription itself.",

These factors form a regulatory network that promotes self-renewal while repressing differentiation genes. When researchers experimentally reduced Oct4 levels below a critical threshold, the cells lost pluripotency and began differentiating. Conversely, overexpression of Oct4 beyond optimal levels also led to differentiation, but toward different cell lineages. This suggests that Oct4 functions within a narrow concentration window to maintain stemness.",
