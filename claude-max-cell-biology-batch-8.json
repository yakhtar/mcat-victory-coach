    "passage": "Researchers studying protein quality control discovered that misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR involves three main sensors: IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. When unfolded proteins accumulate, these sensors become activated and initiate signaling pathways that reduce protein synthesis, enhance ER folding capacity by upregulating chaperones like BiP, and activate ER-associated degradation (ERAD) to remove terminally misfolded proteins. If the stress cannot be resolved, the UPR can ultimately trigger apoptosis.",
    "question": "Based on the UPR mechanism described, which cellular response would be most beneficial during the initial stages of ER stress?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immediate activation of apoptosis to prevent protein aggregation",
      "B": "Increased translation of all proteins to overwhelm the folding machinery",
      "C": "Upregulation of ER chaperones and reduction of new protein synthesis",
      "D": "Complete shutdown of all cellular metabolic processes"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. During initial ER stress, the most beneficial response is to increase the ER's protein-folding capacity (by upregulating chaperones like BiP) while simultaneously reducing the load of new proteins entering the ER (by decreasing translation). This gives the cell time to resolve the protein folding problems. Option A is premature - apoptosis is a last resort when stress cannot be resolved. Option B would worsen the situation by adding more proteins to an already overwhelmed system. Option D is too extreme and would prevent necessary cellular functions.",

    "question": "A researcher observes that cells treated with latrunculin A, which prevents actin polymerization, show defects in cytokinesis but can still complete mitosis. What does this observation suggest about the role of actin in cell division?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Actin is essential for chromosome segregation during anaphase",
      "B": "Actin is required for contractile ring formation during cytokinesis",
      "C": "Actin is necessary for spindle pole organization during metaphase",
      "D": "Actin prevents premature sister chromatid separation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The observation that mitosis can complete normally but cytokinesis is defective indicates that actin is specifically required for cytokinesis, not for the earlier mitotic processes. During cytokinesis, actin and myosin form the contractile ring that pinches the cell in two. Latrunculin A prevents actin polymerization, disrupting contractile ring formation and thus cytokinesis. Options A, C, and D all relate to mitotic processes that were observed to proceed normally in the experiment, ruling out essential roles for actin in those processes.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying epigenetic regulation discovered that DNA methylation at CpG sites is maintained during DNA replication by the enzyme DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1). DNMT1 recognizes hemimethylated CpG sites created after replication and adds methyl groups to the unmethylated cytosines on the newly synthesized strand. This process requires the protein PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger domain 1), which helps recruit DNMT1 to replication foci. When DNMT1 activity is inhibited, cells show progressive loss of DNA methylation with each cell division, leading to reactivation of silenced genes.",
    "question": "Based on this methylation maintenance system, what would be the most likely long-term consequence of UHRF1 deficiency in dividing cells?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Immediate global hypermethylation of all CpG sites",
      "B": "Progressive demethylation and gene reactivation over multiple cell divisions",

      "D": "Complete loss of all epigenetic modifications within one cell cycle"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. UHRF1 is essential for recruiting DNMT1 to replication foci for maintenance methylation. Without UHRF1, DNMT1 cannot efficiently methylate newly synthesized DNA strands, leading to progressive loss of methylation with each cell division (passive demethylation). This would result in gradual reactivation of silenced genes over multiple generations. Option A is incorrect because UHRF1 deficiency would reduce, not increase, methylation. Option C is wrong because UHRF1 specifically affects maintenance methylation, not de novo methylation. Option D is incorrect because the loss would be gradual over multiple divisions, not immediate.",

    "passage": "Researchers investigating cellular aging found that senescent cells exhibit several characteristic features: they stop dividing despite receiving growth signals, show increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p21 and p16, and secrete inflammatory factors in what is called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The team discovered that senescence can be triggered by various stresses including DNA damage, telomere shortening, and oncogene activation. While senescence acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism by preventing potentially cancerous cells from dividing, the accumulation of senescent cells during aging may contribute to tissue dysfunction and inflammation.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Cellular senescence is characterized by permanent growth arrest (cells stop dividing and don't respond to growth signals) but the cells remain metabolically active and continue secreting factors (SASP). This is distinct from temporary cell cycle arrests which can be reversed. Option A is incorrect because senescence involves permanent, not temporary, arrest. Option C is wrong because senescent cells remain alive and active, unlike apoptotic cells which die. Option D is the opposite of what occurs - senescence involves growth arrest, not enhanced proliferation.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying mechanotransduction discovered that cells can sense and respond to mechanical forces through various mechanisms. Integrin-mediated focal adhesions serve as key mechanosensory structures that connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. When mechanical tension is applied, focal adhesions undergo maturation, recruiting additional proteins like vinculin, talin, and α-actinin that strengthen the connection. The researchers found that this mechanosensitive recruitment follows a catch-bond mechanism, where increased force actually stabilizes rather than disrupts the protein interactions, allowing cells to adapt to mechanical stress.",

This is the opposite of normal intuition where increased force would destabilize interactions.

These proteins form trans-SNARE complexes that bring membranes into close proximity. The researchers found that v-SNAREs (vesicle SNAREs) on transport vesicles interact with t-SNAREs (target SNAREs) on the destination membrane. This interaction forms a four-helix bundle that provides the energy needed to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between membranes and drive membrane fusion. After fusion, NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor) and SNAP proteins disassemble the SNARE complex for recycling.",
