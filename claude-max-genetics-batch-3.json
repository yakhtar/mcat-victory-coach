    "passage": "Researchers studying genetic counseling examined how family history information is used to assess disease risk. They analyzed pedigrees for Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant disorder with complete penetrance and late onset. The scientists found that individuals with one affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease allele, but symptoms typically don't appear until age 35-50. This creates ethical dilemmas about genetic testing: should asymptomatic individuals be tested if there's no cure? The researchers concluded that genetic counseling must balance autonomy (right to know/not know) with beneficence (preventing harm) and non-maleficence (avoiding psychological harm).",
    "question": "Based on this genetic counseling scenario, what makes Huntington's disease particularly challenging for genetic counseling?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It's a recessive disorder that's hard to trace in families",
      "B": "The late onset means people may have children before knowing their status, and there's no cure",
      "C": "It shows incomplete penetrance making predictions difficult",
      "D": "It's caused by environmental factors rather than genetics"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage emphasizes that 'symptoms typically don't appear until age 35-50' and asks 'should asymptomatic individuals be tested if there's no cure?' The late onset means people may reproduce before knowing they carry the allele, potentially passing it to children, while the lack of cure makes testing emotionally difficult. Option A is wrong - it's dominant and easily traced. Option C contradicts the 'complete penetrance' mentioned. Option D ignores the genetic basis described.",

    "passage": "Scientists studying somatic mosaicism discovered that not all cells in an organism carry identical DNA sequences. During development, spontaneous mutations can arise in somatic cells, creating patches of genetically distinct tissue within the same individual. The researchers found this phenomenon in cancer, where tumor cells accumulate mutations that differ from normal tissue, and in neurological disorders, where brain mosaicism can cause focal epilepsy. They also discovered that somatic mosaicism is more common than previously thought, with studies showing that even healthy individuals carry numerous somatic mutations in different tissues, challenging the concept of a uniform genetic identity.",

    "options": {
      "A": "All individuals have identical DNA sequences in every cell",

The passage states that 'spontaneous mutations can arise in somatic cells, creating patches of genetically distinct tissue within the same individual' and that 'even healthy individuals carry numerous somatic mutations in different tissues.'

A carrier is an individual who has one copy of a recessive allele (heterozygous) but doesn't express the recessive phenotype because they also have a dominant allele.

    "passage": "A research team studying genetic diseases examined the inheritance pattern of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder where individuals cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine due to deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme. They found that PKU follows autosomal recessive inheritance - affected individuals must have two copies of the mutant allele. The scientists discovered that untreated PKU leads to intellectual disability because phenylalanine accumulates to toxic levels, but early detection through newborn screening and dietary restriction (low-phenylalanine diet) can prevent symptoms entirely.",
    "question": "Based on this PKU inheritance pattern, what is the risk for two PKU carriers (heterozygotes) to have an affected child?",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. For autosomal recessive inheritance, two carriers (Aa × Aa) have a 25% chance of having an affected child (aa). The Punnett square shows: AA (25%), Aa (50%), aa (25%). Only the aa genotype expresses PKU. Option A ignores the recessive alleles. Option C is the carrier probability.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Genomic imprinting causes genes to be expressed differently depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or father, due to epigenetic marks (usually DNA methylation) applied during gametogenesis.

They studied Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, finding that both are caused by expanding trinucleotide repeats (CAG in Huntington's, CTG in myotonic dystrophy). The scientists found that these repeat sequences are unstable during DNA replication and tend to expand when passed from parent to child, particularly through paternal inheritance in Huntington's disease. Longer repeat lengths correlate with earlier onset and more severe symptoms, explaining the anticipation phenomenon.",
    "question": "Based on this genetic anticipation research, what molecular mechanism causes diseases to become more severe in successive generations?",

      "A": "Accumulation of random mutations over time",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that 'expanding trinucleotide repeats...are unstable during DNA replication and tend to expand when passed from parent to child' and that 'longer repeat lengths correlate with earlier onset and more severe symptoms.' This expansion mechanism directly causes anticipation. Option A describes general mutation accumulation, not the specific repeat expansion. Option C involves environmental factors.

The researchers discovered that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify genetic variants associated with complex traits, but these variants typically explain only a small fraction of the heritability, leading to the 'missing heritability' problem.",
