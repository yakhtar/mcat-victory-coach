    "passage": "Researchers studying cardiac physiology discovered that the heart's electrical conduction system ensures coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle. The sinoatrial (SA) node initiates electrical impulses that spread through the atria, causing atrial contraction. The impulse then reaches the atrioventricular (AV) node, which delays transmission to allow complete atrial emptying before ventricular contraction begins. From the AV node, the impulse travels through the bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers to stimulate ventricular contraction. The researchers found that this intrinsic conduction system allows the heart to beat independently of nervous system control, though it can be modulated by autonomic input.",
    "question": "Based on this cardiac conduction system, what is the functional significance of the delay at the AV node?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To prevent the heart from beating too rapidly",
      "B": "To ensure complete atrial emptying before ventricular contraction begins",
      "C": "To allow time for coronary blood flow during systole",
      "D": "To coordinate contraction with respiratory cycles"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage specifically states that the AV node 'delays transmission to allow complete atrial emptying before ventricular contraction begins.' This delay ensures proper filling of the ventricles and optimal cardiac output. Option A is not the primary function of the AV delay. Option C relates to coronary perfusion but not the AV delay. Option D describes a different physiological mechanism.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, where it increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion through regulation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and Na+/K+-ATPase pumps. Option A (glomerulus) is the site of filtration. Option B (proximal tubule) handles bulk reabsorption but is less responsive to aldosterone. Option C (loop of Henle) is primarily involved in concentrating urine.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating respiratory physiology found that ventilation is controlled by multiple mechanisms to maintain appropriate blood gas levels. The medullary respiratory center contains the pre-BÃ¶tzinger complex, which generates the basic respiratory rhythm. Chemoreceptors in the medulla are primarily sensitive to CO2/H+ levels in cerebrospinal fluid, while peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies respond to decreased O2, increased CO2, and decreased pH. The researchers discovered that under normal conditions, CO2 levels are the primary driver of breathing, but during severe hypoxia, oxygen levels become the dominant stimulus. Additionally, they found that voluntary control from the cerebral cortex can temporarily override automatic control.",
    "question": "Based on this respiratory control system, why might administering high-concentration oxygen to patients with chronic CO2 retention be potentially dangerous?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Oxygen is toxic at high concentrations",
      "B": "High oxygen may eliminate the hypoxic drive to breathe in patients dependent on low O2 for respiratory stimulation",
      "C": "Oxygen interferes with CO2 transport in the blood",
      "D": "High oxygen always causes immediate respiratory depression in all patients"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Patients with chronic CO2 retention may become dependent on hypoxic drive (low oxygen stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors) rather than the normal CO2 drive for breathing. Administering high-concentration oxygen could eliminate this hypoxic stimulus, potentially leading to respiratory depression. Option A is true but not the mechanism relevant here. Option C is incorrect. Option D overstates the effect - this primarily affects patients with chronic CO2 retention.",

The stomach primarily secretes gastric acid and pepsinogen, beginning protein digestion. The duodenum receives pancreatic enzymes and bile, continuing digestion of all major macronutrients. The jejunum is the primary site for absorption of carbohydrates, proteins, and water-soluble vitamins, while the ileum specializes in absorbing vitamin B12, bile salts, and fat-soluble vitamins. The researchers found that this regional specialization maximizes absorption efficiency and prevents nutrient loss.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying immune system function discovered that T cell activation requires two distinct signals to prevent inappropriate immune responses. Signal 1 involves recognition of antigen presented on MHC molecules by the T cell receptor (TCR). Signal 2 comes from costimulatory molecules like CD28 on T cells binding to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Without both signals, T cells become anergic (unresponsive) or undergo apoptosis. The scientists found that this two-signal requirement prevents autoimmune responses by ensuring T cells are only activated when professional antigen-presenting cells are present, indicating a legitimate immune threat.",

When blood glucose rises after a meal, pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin, which promotes glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells and stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver. When blood glucose falls, pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon, which stimulates hepatic glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The researchers found that this reciprocal regulation by insulin and glucagon represents a classic example of negative feedback control in physiological systems.",
