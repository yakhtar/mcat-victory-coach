## 🚨 **TOMORROW'S STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS (Phase 1B Ready):**

### **Step 1: Tell Claude Where We Are**
When you start Claude tomorrow, copy and paste this EXACT message:

```
We completed Phase 1A of the MCAT platform! Here's what we accomplished:
- ✅ Smart AI routing (Claude for biochemistry, OpenAI for general)
- ✅ Enhanced biochemistry content with 515+ focus
- ✅ Progress tracking system with recommendations 
- ✅ 6-week study pathways for 515+ scores
- ✅ All APIs tested and working perfectly

The platform is running at http://localhost:3003 with all features working.

NEXT: Please help me start Phase 1B - Production Deployment to Render.com and GitHub setup for VelocityAI Solutions multi-vertical expansion.

Current working directory: C:\Users\akhta\my_projects\Sub-Agents\projects\mcat-platform-clean
```

### **Step 2: Start the Platform**
1. Open command prompt
2. Type: `cd "C:\Users\akhta\my_projects\Sub-Agents\projects\mcat-platform-clean"`
3. Type: `node mcat-victory-platform.js`
4. Look for: "🚀 MCAT Victory Platform running on http://localhost:3003"
5. Test at: http://localhost:3003

### **Step 3: Verify Everything Works**
Test these URLs to make sure everything is working:
- Health check: http://localhost:3003/api/health
- Should show: "biochemistry_focus": "enhanced" and "ai_integration": "claude + openai"

### **Step 4: If Something Doesn't Work**
1. **If server won't start**: Check that you're in the right folder (see Step 2)
2. **If API health check fails**: Wait 30 seconds for the server to fully start
3. **If still having issues**: Copy and paste the error message to Claude

### **Step 5: Tell Claude We're Ready for Phase 1B**
After everything is working, tell Claude:
```
Everything is working! The platform is running perfectly. Let's start Phase 1B - GitHub setup and Render.com deployment for VelocityAI Solutions.
```
