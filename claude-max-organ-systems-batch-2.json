    "passage": "Researchers studying muscle physiology discovered that skeletal muscle contraction follows the sliding filament model. Muscle fibers contain myofibrils composed of repeating sarcomeres, the basic contractile units. Each sarcomere contains thick filaments (myosin) and thin filaments (actin) arranged in overlapping patterns. During contraction, myosin heads bind to actin forming cross-bridges, then pivot using ATP energy to pull actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. The scientists found that calcium ions regulate this process by binding to troponin, causing tropomyosin to shift and expose myosin-binding sites on actin.",
    "question": "Based on this sliding filament mechanism, what is the direct role of calcium in muscle contraction?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Calcium provides the energy for myosin head pivoting",
      "B": "Calcium binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to expose myosin-binding sites on actin",
      "C": "Calcium directly binds to myosin to activate cross-bridge formation",
      "D": "Calcium synthesizes ATP for muscle contraction"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'calcium ions regulate this process by binding to troponin, causing tropomyosin to shift and expose myosin-binding sites on actin.' This regulatory mechanism allows cross-bridge formation to proceed. Option A is incorrect - ATP provides energy. Option C is wrong - calcium binds to troponin, not myosin directly. Option D confuses calcium's role with ATP synthesis.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating immune system development discovered that T cells undergo positive and negative selection in the thymus to ensure proper function. During positive selection, T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules receive survival signals, while those that cannot undergo apoptosis. In negative selection, T cells that strongly bind to self-antigens presented on MHC molecules are eliminated to prevent autoimmunity. The researchers found that only 2-5% of developing T cells survive both selection processes. This stringent quality control ensures that mature T cells can recognize foreign antigens presented on self-MHC but don't attack the body's own tissues.",
    "question": "Based on this thymic selection process, what would happen to a developing T cell that cannot recognize self-MHC molecules?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It would be positively selected and mature normally",
      "B": "It would undergo apoptosis during positive selection",
      "C": "It would be eliminated during negative selection",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that during positive selection, 'T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules receive survival signals, while those that cannot undergo apoptosis.' A T cell unable to recognize self-MHC would fail positive selection and die. Option A contradicts the selection requirement. Option C describes negative selection.

    "passage": "A research team studying gastrointestinal motility examined how the enteric nervous system controls digestive movements. They discovered that the enteric nervous system contains more neurons than the spinal cord and can function independently of central nervous control. Peristalsis, the coordinated wave-like contractions that propel food through the digestive tract, is initiated by stretch receptors and coordinated by myenteric plexus neurons. The researchers found that these contractions involve sequential contraction of smooth muscle above the food bolus and relaxation below it, creating a pressure gradient that moves contents forward.",

    "passage": "Researchers studying renal physiology discovered that the countercurrent multiplier system in the loop of Henle creates a concentration gradient that enables water conservation. The descending limb is permeable to water but not solutes, while the ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports sodium and chloride out. This creates an increasing osmolarity gradient from cortex to medulla. The scientists found that antidiuretic hormone (ADH) controls final urine concentration by regulating aquaporin-2 water channels in the collecting duct, allowing fine-tuning of water reabsorption based on body hydration status.",

The passage explains that 'the descending limb is permeable to water but not solutes, while the ascending limb is impermeable to water but actively transports sodium and chloride out.' Water loss from the descending limb and solute removal by the ascending limb work together to create and maintain the medullary osmotic gradient. Option A is incorrect about water transport.

Osteoblasts secrete collagen matrix and promote mineralization to build new bone, while osteoclasts secrete acids and enzymes to dissolve bone mineral and matrix.
