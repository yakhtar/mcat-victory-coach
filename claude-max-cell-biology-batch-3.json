    "passage": "Research on Hedgehog signaling revealed that in the absence of Hedgehog ligand, the Patched (Ptc) receptor inhibits Smoothened (Smo), keeping it in an inactive state. This allows the transcription factor Gli to be processed into its repressor form (GliR) by protein kinase A (PKA), which then enters the nucleus and represses target genes. However, when Hedgehog binds to Patched, this inhibition is relieved, allowing Smoothened to become active. Active Smoothened then prevents Gli processing, allowing full-length Gli to act as an activator (GliA) and upregulate target genes including Ptc itself and other developmental regulators.",
    "question": "What is the functional consequence of Hedgehog signaling creating a negative feedback loop by upregulating Patched expression?",
    "options": {
      "A": "It ensures continuous activation of the pathway once initiated",
      "B": "It provides a mechanism to attenuate signaling and prevent overstimulation",
      "C": "It amplifies the signal to neighboring cells",
      "D": "It prevents cross-talk with other signaling pathways"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The upregulation of Patched (Ptc) by Hedgehog signaling creates a negative feedback loop because Patched is the receptor that inhibits Smoothened when not bound by Hedgehog. By increasing Patched levels, the cell increases its capacity to bind and sequester Hedgehog ligand, and also increases the inhibitory activity on Smoothened. This provides a mechanism to attenuate signaling and prevent overstimulation, which is crucial for proper development and tissue homeostasis. Option A is incorrect because the feedback is negative, not positive. Option C is wrong because this feedback doesn't directly relate to signal amplification to other cells. Option D is incorrect because the primary function isn't to prevent pathway cross-talk.",

    "question": "Researchers studying ciliopathies found that mutations in IFT (intraflagellar transport) proteins lead to defective cilia formation and multiple developmental abnormalities. IFT involves bidirectional movement of protein complexes along axonemal microtubules. Which of the following cellular processes would be most directly affected by loss of anterograde IFT?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Ciliary resorption during cell cycle progression",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Anterograde IFT (toward the ciliary tip) is essential for transporting structural components needed for ciliary assembly and maintenance, including tubulin subunits for microtubule extension and other axonemal proteins. Loss of anterograde IFT would prevent proper delivery of these building blocks, directly affecting the assembly and maintenance of the ciliary axoneme structure. Option A is incorrect because ciliary resorption involves different mechanisms and would more likely be affected by retrograde IFT. Option C is wrong because receptor recycling primarily involves retrograde IFT. Option D is incorrect because basal body positioning occurs before ciliary assembly and doesn't directly depend on anterograde IFT within the cilium.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating apoptosis discovered that mitochondria play a central role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. During cellular stress, pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and Bak oligomerize in the outer mitochondrial membrane, forming pores that allow cytochrome c to leak into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c then binds to Apaf-1, promoting the formation of the apoptosome complex. This complex recruits and activates procaspase-9, which then cleaves and activates executioner caspases like caspase-3 and caspase-7, leading to systematic dismantling of cellular components.",
    "question": "What would be the expected result if cells were treated with a compound that specifically prevents cytochrome c release from mitochondria without affecting other mitochondrial functions?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Apoptosis would be completely blocked in all pathways",
      "B": "Only the intrinsic apoptotic pathway would be inhibited",
      "C": "Caspase-independent cell death would be enhanced",
      "D": "The extrinsic apoptotic pathway would be upregulated"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The compound would specifically block the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway because cytochrome c release is a critical step unique to this pathway. Without cytochrome c in the cytoplasm, the apoptosome cannot form, procaspase-9 cannot be activated, and the downstream executioner caspases cannot be triggered through this route. However, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is initiated by death receptors and directly activates caspase-8, would remain functional and could still induce apoptosis. Option A is incorrect because other apoptotic pathways would still function. Option C is wrong because blocking apoptosis wouldn't enhance caspase-independent death. Option D is incorrect because there's no mechanism by which blocking cytochrome c release would upregulate the extrinsic pathway.",

The process is regulated by transcription factors like Snail, Slug, and Twist, which directly repress E-cadherin gene expression. Additionally, these cells showed increased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, cytoskeletal reorganization from cortical actin to stress fibers, and enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production.",

      "D": "Stress fiber formation improves cellular energy metabolism"

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. EMT promotes invasion and metastasis through multiple coordinated changes: loss of E-cadherin reduces cell-cell adhesion, allowing cells to detach from the primary tumor; cytoskeletal reorganization (cortical actin to stress fibers) enhances cell motility; and increased MMP production degrades extracellular matrix components, creating pathways for cell migration. Together, these changes enable cancer cells to break away from the original tumor mass and invade surrounding tissues. Option B is incorrect because N-cadherin doesn't primarily affect proliferation but rather cell-matrix interactions. Option C is wrong because vimentin is a structural protein that doesn't directly activate oncogenes. Option D is incorrect because stress fibers are involved in motility, not metabolism.",

    "passage": "Studies on mechanotransduction revealed that cells can sense and respond to mechanical forces through various mechanisms. Focal adhesions, composed of integrins and associated proteins like focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. When mechanical tension is applied, these structures undergo force-dependent conformational changes that expose cryptic binding sites and activate signaling cascades. Additionally, mechanosensitive ion channels in the plasma membrane can open in response to membrane deformation, leading to rapid calcium influx and immediate cellular responses.",

Phosphorylation can alter transcription factor activity, localization, or stability, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression. This represents a classical signal transduction pathway from mechanical stimulus to transcriptional response. Option A is incorrect because while nuclear mechanotransduction exists, the question specifically asks about focal adhesion signaling.

    "passage": "Investigation of lysosomal storage diseases revealed that deficiencies in specific lysosomal enzymes lead to accumulation of undigested substrates within lysosomes. In Tay-Sachs disease, mutations in the HEXA gene result in deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A, leading to accumulation of GM2 ganglioside primarily in neurons. The enzyme deficiency prevents normal breakdown of this sphingolipid, causing progressive neurodegeneration. Interestingly, while the enzyme can be produced normally in other cell types, neurons are particularly vulnerable due to their high ganglioside content and limited regenerative capacity.",

Neurons are particularly susceptible to Tay-Sachs disease because they have high concentrations of GM2 ganglioside (the substrate that accumulates when β-hexosaminidase A is deficient) and have limited regenerative capacity. The high substrate load means more material accumulates in neuronal lysosomes, and unlike many other cell types, neurons cannot be easily replaced once damaged, making the progressive accumulation particularly devastating. Option A is incorrect because the passage indicates the enzyme can be produced in other cell types, and the problem is deficiency, not overproduction.
