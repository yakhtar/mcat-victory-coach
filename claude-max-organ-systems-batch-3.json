    "passage": "Researchers studying pulmonary gas exchange discovered that efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer depends on the structural properties of the respiratory membrane. The alveolar-capillary membrane consists of the alveolar epithelium, basement membrane, and capillary endothelium - collectively only 0.5 micrometers thick to facilitate rapid diffusion. The scientists found that surface tension in alveoli is reduced by surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes, preventing alveolar collapse during expiration. They calculated that the lungs' 300 million alveoli provide approximately 70 square meters of surface area for gas exchange.",
    "question": "Based on this pulmonary structure, what is the primary function of surfactant in the alveoli?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To increase oxygen solubility in blood",
      "B": "To reduce surface tension and prevent alveolar collapse during expiration",
      "C": "To actively transport gases across the respiratory membrane",
      "D": "To increase the thickness of the respiratory membrane"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'surface tension in alveoli is reduced by surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes, preventing alveolar collapse during expiration.' Surfactant is crucial for maintaining alveolar stability, especially in newborns. Option A relates to gas solubility, not surface tension. Option C describes active transport, but gas exchange is passive. Option D would impair gas exchange.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating synaptic transmission discovered that neurotransmitter release is a highly regulated process involving calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. When an action potential reaches the synaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing Ca2+ influx. The increased intracellular calcium triggers SNARE protein conformational changes that promote vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The researchers found that different neurotransmitters have distinct receptors and effects: acetylcholine activates nicotinic receptors (excitatory) at neuromuscular junctions, while GABA activates GABA_A receptors (inhibitory) in the brain.",
    "question": "Based on this synaptic transmission mechanism, what is the direct trigger for neurotransmitter vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane?",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. The passage clearly states that 'voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing Ca2+ influx' and that 'increased intracellular calcium triggers SNARE protein conformational changes that promote vesicle fusion.'

    "passage": "A research team studying hormonal regulation of metabolism examined how insulin and glucagon work together to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. During fed states, rising blood glucose stimulates pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin, which promotes glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells and stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver. During fasting states, falling blood glucose stimulates pancreatic alpha cells to secrete glucagon, which promotes hepatic glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The scientists found that this dual hormonal system maintains blood glucose within a narrow range despite varying dietary intake and metabolic demands.",
    "question": "Based on this glucose homeostasis system, what would happen to blood glucose levels if pancreatic alpha cells were selectively destroyed?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Blood glucose would remain constantly elevated",
      "B": "Blood glucose would be unable to rise during fasting, leading to hypoglycemia",

      "D": "Glycogen synthesis would be completely blocked"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Alpha cells secrete glucagon, which 'promotes hepatic glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis' during fasting. Without alpha cells, the body couldn't mobilize glucose from liver stores during fasting, leading to potentially dangerous hypoglycemia. Option A describes the opposite effect. Option C might occur as compensation but isn't the primary problem. Option D relates to insulin's effects, which would still function.",

The P wave represents atrial depolarization, the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization (which masks atrial repolarization), and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization. The scientists found that the PR interval reflects conduction time through the AV node, while the QT interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Abnormalities in these intervals can indicate various cardiac pathologies.",

A prolonged PR interval indicates slower than normal conduction through the AV node, characteristic of first-degree heart block. This is a delay, not a complete block.

    "passage": "Scientists studying renal regulation of acid-base balance discovered that the kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining blood pH within the narrow range of 7.35-7.45. The kidneys regulate pH through several mechanisms: reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate in the proximal tubule, secreting hydrogen ions in the distal tubule and collecting duct, and generating new bicarbonate through ammonia production and titratable acid formation. The researchers found that these processes can take hours to days to fully compensate for acid-base disturbances, unlike the immediate respiratory compensation that adjusts CO2 levels.",
