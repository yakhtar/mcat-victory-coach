    "passage": "Researchers studying cancer genetics discovered that most cancers require multiple genetic hits to develop, supporting Knudson's two-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressor genes. They found that individuals with inherited mutations in tumor suppressor genes like BRCA1, TP53, or RB1 have higher cancer risk because they need only one additional 'hit' to lose tumor suppressor function completely. In contrast, oncogenes typically require only one activating mutation to contribute to cancer development. The scientists observed that cancer cells often show genomic instability, accumulating additional mutations that drive progression from benign to malignant tumors.",
    "question": "Based on Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, why do individuals with inherited BRCA1 mutations have higher breast cancer risk?",
    "options": {
      "A": "BRCA1 mutations directly cause breast cancer",
      "B": "They already have one 'hit' and need only one additional mutation to lose BRCA1 function completely",
      "C": "BRCA1 mutations prevent all DNA repair",
      "D": "Inherited mutations are more harmful than somatic mutations"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The two-hit hypothesis states that both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must be inactivated for cancer to develop. Individuals with inherited BRCA1 mutations start with one defective copy in all cells, so they need only one additional somatic mutation to lose BRCA1 function completely, dramatically increasing cancer risk. Option A oversimplifies - multiple hits are usually needed. Option C overstates the effect. Option D isn't the mechanism described.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. Turner syndrome (45,X) typically results in gonadal dysgenesis with underdeveloped ovaries, leading to infertility and inability to reproduce naturally. While some individuals with mosaic forms may retain some ovarian function, classic Turner syndrome generally prevents reproduction. Option A assumes reproduction occurs. Options C and D assume normal reproductive capability.",

    "passage": "Scientists investigating genetic mosaicism discovered that some individuals carry two or more genetically distinct cell populations within their body. This can result from somatic mutations during development, chromosomal nondisjunction in early embryonic divisions, or chimerism (fusion of two embryos). The researchers found that mosaicism can have varied clinical consequences: some cases are asymptomatic, while others cause developmental abnormalities or predispose to cancer. They observed that the phenotypic effects depend on when during development the genetic change occurred, which cell types are affected, and what genes are involved.",
    "question": "Based on this genetic mosaicism research, what factors determine the severity of clinical consequences in mosaic individuals?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Only the type of genetic change, not the timing",
      "B": "The timing of the genetic change during development, which cell types are affected, and the genes involved",

      "D": "Only environmental factors after birth"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that 'phenotypic effects depend on when during development the genetic change occurred, which cell types are affected, and what genes are involved.' Early changes affect more cells, changes in critical cell lineages have greater impact, and mutations in essential genes cause more severe effects. Option A ignores timing and cell type factors.

    "passage": "A research team studying genetic disorders examined how consanguinity (marriage between relatives) affects disease risk in populations. They found that children of consanguineous marriages have increased risk for autosomal recessive disorders because related parents are more likely to carry the same rare recessive alleles inherited from common ancestors. The scientists calculated that first cousins share 1/8 of their genes, making it more probable that both parents are carriers for the same recessive condition. They observed that this effect is most pronounced for rare recessive disorders.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that 'related parents are more likely to carry the same rare recessive alleles inherited from common ancestors.' When both parents carry the same recessive allele, there's a 25% chance their children will be homozygous recessive and express the disorder. Option A relates to mutation rates, not inheritance.

      "D": "Females have stronger immune systems"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. X-inactivation (lyonization) randomly silences one X chromosome in each female cell during early development, creating a mosaic of cells expressing different X chromosomes. This can lead to variable expression of X-linked traits in females, from mild to severe, depending on the pattern of X-inactivation. Option A explains the genetic basis but not the variability. Option C is about susceptibility, not variability. Option D is unrelated to X-linked expression.",

They discovered that variations in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and drug targets can dramatically alter therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. For example, individuals with certain CYP2D6 variants metabolize antidepressants slowly, requiring dose adjustments to avoid toxicity. The scientists found that genetic testing before prescribing certain medications can improve treatment outcomes and reduce adverse drug reactions, leading to more precise, individualized therapy.",

They found that gene flow - the movement of alleles between populations through migration - tends to homogenize allele frequencies across populations, reducing genetic differentiation.

However, they also discovered that when migration stops, populations can diverge rapidly through genetic drift and local adaptation to different environments.",
