    "passage": "Researchers studying protein synthesis discovered that ribosomes undergo a complex series of conformational changes during translation elongation. The ribosome contains three binding sites: A (aminoacyl), P (peptidyl), and E (exit). During elongation, aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site, peptide bond formation occurs, and then the ribosome translocates, moving tRNAs from A to P to E sites. The scientists found that elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G facilitate these processes, with EF-Tu delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site and EF-G promoting translocation. Both factors are GTPases that undergo conformational changes upon GTP hydrolysis to drive the translation cycle.",
    "question": "Based on this translation mechanism, what is the primary role of GTP hydrolysis by elongation factors?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To provide energy for peptide bond formation",
      "B": "To drive conformational changes that facilitate ribosome movement and tRNA positioning",
      "C": "To directly synthesize new amino acids",
      "D": "To terminate translation when the stop codon is reached"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is B. The passage states that elongation factors 'are GTPases that undergo conformational changes upon GTP hydrolysis to drive the translation cycle.' GTP hydrolysis provides the energy for conformational changes in these factors that facilitate ribosome translocation and proper tRNA positioning. Option A is incorrect - peptide bond formation is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase. Option C is wrong - amino acids are not synthesized during translation. Option D describes the role of release factors, not elongation factors.",

Serine 2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II's C-terminal domain (CTD) is associated with transcription elongation and is specifically required for efficient transcription termination and recruitment of mRNA processing factors (capping, splicing, polyadenylation).

    "passage": "Scientists investigating epigenetic inheritance studied how histone modifications can be maintained through DNA replication and cell division. They discovered that during S phase, parental histones are distributed between leading and lagging strands, creating hemimethylated nucleosomes that serve as templates for restoring full methylation patterns. The researchers found that histone chaperones like CAF-1 and ASF1 help deposit both parental and newly synthesized histones onto replicating DNA. Additionally, they identified enzymes like PCNA-associated UHRF1 that recognize hemimethylated CpG sites and recruit DNMT1 to maintain DNA methylation patterns. This coordinated system ensures epigenetic information is faithfully transmitted to daughter cells.",

The mRNA sequence is complementary to the template strand with U replacing T: 3'-TACGGATCC-5' template produces 5'-AUGCCUAGG-3' mRNA. Options B and D have incorrect directionality.

    "passage": "A research team studying DNA replication fidelity discovered that DNA polymerases have different error rates and proofreading capabilities. DNA polymerase III, the main replicative enzyme in prokaryotes, has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity that allows it to remove incorrectly incorporated nucleotides immediately after addition. This proofreading function reduces the error rate from approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000. Additionally, post-replicative mismatch repair systems can detect and correct remaining errors, further improving overall fidelity. The researchers concluded that this multi-layered error correction system is essential for maintaining genomic stability.",

    "passage": "Researchers investigating the molecular basis of aging studied how DNA damage accumulates over time and affects cellular function. They found that cells experience thousands of DNA lesions daily from both endogenous sources (reactive oxygen species, replication errors) and exogenous sources (UV radiation, chemicals). While most damage is repaired, some lesions persist and can cause mutations or trigger cellular senescence. The scientists discovered that telomere shortening acts as a molecular clock, limiting cell divisions and eventually leading to senescence or apoptosis. They concluded that the balance between DNA damage and repair capacity determines cellular longevity and contributes to organismal aging.",

They found that stress-response genes often contain multiple binding sites for stress-activated transcription factors like NF-κB, AP-1, and heat shock factors. These transcription factors are normally inactive but become activated through post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation) or by release from inhibitory proteins during stress conditions. The researchers observed that this system allows cells to quickly upregulate protective genes without requiring new protein synthesis, providing a rapid response to potentially harmful conditions.",
